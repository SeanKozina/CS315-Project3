Created by Sean Kozina in the fall of 2022
This was my third and final project for my "Data Structures" class
this project is supposed to demonstrate knowlege on how to complete 
problems in two different ways. First being iterative and the second being recrusion.

The text files are means to test my solutions for the 4 problems solved.
